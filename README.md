# The magnitude vector of images


This repository contains the code for our recent paper "The magnitude vector of images"

This repository is designed to be used in conjunction with the BIPEDv2 dataset which can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lZuvJxL4dvhVGgiITmZsjUJPBBrFI_bM).

We provide code to calculate the baselines, the magnitude models discussed in the paper, and reproduce our theoretical validations.
